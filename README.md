Drawer Botter

Our project can take in [X, Y] coordinated and draw it onto any surface, with only two stepper motors! Using a polar coordinate system, combined with a variation of CNC gcode, two news 17 stepper motors can move a pen across a 2D plane, leaving whatever image you desire!

Files:
code.ino - Arduino Uno Code
gantry.stl - Designed in Fusion 360, then 3d printed the pen holding (and weight holding) gantry
python_drawing.py - Python code used to create the example images (created the coordinates for all images drawn
